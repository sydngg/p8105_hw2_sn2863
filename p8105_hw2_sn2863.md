This data set contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, it collects the
trash and stores it in the dumpster.

Contains information on year, month, and the total trash collected.
There are a total of **344** observations in our final Mr. Trash Wheel
data set.

Additional data include month precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

# Problem 2

This data set contains information about the New York City subway
system’s station entrances and exits, as well as train routes. It also
contains information about vending, ADA compliance, staffing, and exact
geographical coordinates.

There are a total of 1868 observations in our final data set. We have
specifically pulled line, station name, station latitude/longitude,
routes, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance variables to
work with.

  - There are **465** distinct subway stations by station name and line.
  - There are **468** stations that are ADA compliant.
  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending that
    allow entrance is **0.3770492**.

#### Reformat the data so route number and route name are distinct variables

``` r
# need to make all route# variable types consistent first before pivot_longer()
# decided to make all routes character variables, and dropped any missing routes

subway_reformat_df <- 
  subway_df %>%
  mutate(route8 = as.character(route8),
         route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10),
         route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_prefix = "route",
               names_to = "route_num", values_to = "route") %>%
  drop_na(route)

head(subway_reformat_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 10

    ## 5 4 Av~ 36th St                  40.7            -74.0     1 YES    
    ## 6 4 Av~ 36th St                  40.7            -74.0     1 YES    
    ## # ... with 4 more variables: entrance_type <chr>, ada <lgl>, route_num <chr>,
    ## #   route <chr>

Further filtering by the A route and then answering questions:

``` r
distinct_stations_A <-
  subway_reformat_df %>%
  filter(route == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

ada_stations_A <-
  subway_reformat_df %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  - There are **60** distinct stations that serve the A train.
  - Of the stations that serve the A train, **84** are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

#### Clean the data in `pols-month.csv`

``` r
pols_month_df <- 
  read_csv("./hw2_prob3/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE)

month_df <- tibble(month= 01:12, month_name = month.name) # month names

pols_month_df <- 
  left_join(month_df, pols_month_df, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_gop == 1 ~ "Republican",
                               prez_gop == 0 ~ "Democrat",
                               prez_gop == 2 ~ "Other")) %>%
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day, -month) # removing variables
```

#### Clean the data in `snp.csv` using a similar process to the above

``` r
snp_df <- 
  read_csv("./hw2_prob3/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>%
  left_join(month_df, snp_df, by = "month") %>%
  select(year, month_name, close)
```

#### Tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets.

``` r
unemployment_df <- 
  read_csv("./hw2_prob3/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(2:13, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment")

month_abb_df <- tibble(month = month.abb, month_name = month.name) # month names

unemployment_df <- 
  left_join(month_abb_df, unemployment_df, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(year = Year) %>% # renaming Year to year to stay consistent
  select(year, month_name, unemployment)
```

#### Join the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and merging `unemployment` into the result.

``` r
FiveThirtyEight_df <- 
  left_join(snp_df, pols_month_df, by = c("year", "month_name")) %>%
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month_name"))

head(FiveThirtyEight_df)
```

    ## # ... with 2 more variables: president <chr>, unemployment <dbl>

The `pols-month` data set gives us information about the number of
national politicians who are Democratic or Republican at any given date.
Variables describe the number of representatives at different levels
including the Executive level, senators and House Reps, and governors.
The range of years is from 1947 to 2015.

The `snp` data set gives us information about the S\&P stock market
index with a date variable and the closing value of the index on that
date. The range of years is from 1950 to 2015.

The `unemployment` data set gives us information about percentages of
unemployment given a year and month. The range of years is from 1948 to
2015.

The combined data set `FiveThirtyEight` has 787 observations and 11
variables. The range of years is from 1950 to 2015 and features
important variables including the S\&P stock market index at close,
unemployment percentages, and whether the President was a Democrat or
Republican at the time.
