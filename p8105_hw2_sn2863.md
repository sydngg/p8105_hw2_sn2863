# Problem 1

``` r
trashwheel_df <-
  read_excel("./hw2_prob1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
             range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% # specify a column to look at
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
         sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
precip_2018_df <-
  read_excel("./hw2_prob1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017_df <-
  read_excel("./hw2_prob1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
             skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combining annual precipitation for 2017 and 2018.

``` r
precip_df <- bind_rows(precip_2017_df, precip_2018_df)
  #mutate(month = lubridate::month(month))
         # month_name = month.name[month]) 
         # don't use square brackets Jeff doesn't like them

month_df <- tibble(month= 1:12, month_name = month.name)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This data set contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, it collects the
trash and stores it in the dumpster.

Contains information on year, month, and the total trash collected.
There are a total of **344** observations in our final Mr. Trash Wheel
data set.

Additional data include month precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

# Problem 2

``` r
subway_df <-
  read_csv("./hw2_prob2/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11,
         entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", 1, 0))
  

head(subway_df) # just to check it out -- this was not asked for in hw
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 19
    ##   line  station_name station_latitude station_longitu~ route1 route2 route3
    ##   <chr> <chr>                   <dbl>            <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr> 
    ## 1 4 Av~ 25th St                  40.7            -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
    ## 2 4 Av~ 25th St                  40.7            -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
    ## 3 4 Av~ 36th St                  40.7            -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
    ## 4 4 Av~ 36th St                  40.7            -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
    ## 5 4 Av~ 36th St                  40.7            -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
    ## 6 4 Av~ 45th St                  40.6            -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
    ## # ... with 12 more variables: route4 <chr>, route5 <chr>, route6 <chr>,
    ## #   route7 <chr>, route8 <dbl>, route9 <dbl>, route10 <dbl>, route11 <dbl>,
    ## #   entry <dbl>, vending <chr>, entrance_type <chr>, ada <lgl>

  - There are **465** distinct subway stations by station name and line.
  - There are **468** stations that are ADA compliant.
  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending that
    allow entrance is **0.3770492**.

### Reformat the data so route number and route name are distinct variables

``` r
# need to make all route# variable types consistent first before pivot_longer()
# decided to make all routes character variables, and dropped any missing routes

subway_reformat_df <- 
  subway_df %>%
  mutate(route8 = as.character(route8),
         route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10),
         route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_prefix = "route",
               names_to = "route_num", values_to = "route") %>%
  drop_na(route)
```

Further filtering by the A route and answering questions:

``` r
distinct_stations_A <-
  subway_reformat_df %>%
  filter(route == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

ada_stations_A <-
  subway_reformat_df %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  - There are **60** distinct stations that serve the A train.
  - Of the stations that serve the A train, **84** are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

### Part A

``` r
pols_month_df <- read_csv("./hw2_prob3/pols-month.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )
